        <p>“I used to have thoughts of wanting to climb to the top of something, or wanting to be somebody. But when you get the thing that you think you want and then you wake up and realize that you still have pockets of sadness, and that your struggle will reinvent itself, you stop chasing after those things and it’s liberating, because you realize that right here, right now, is exactly all I need.”<br>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Ever since Chris Evans landed the role of Captain America in the MCU, fans from around the world have been keeping up with his life constantly. Evans was known before he was cast for the films, but he has truly become one of the industry's most famous names after nearly 10 years of playing Cap. A perfect example of how the MCU helped Evans is that he landed a role in the star-studded cast of Knives Out. It was his first role after Avengers: Endgame.<br>
        Throughout the many movies that Evans has been a part of throughout his career, fans have had the opportunity to learn more about him. Although, there's only so much that you can learn about a player through a movie.

  <h2 id="own-head"> Top 5 Best Movies (According To IMDb):</h2>
  <div class="owner">
    <img src="imges/resizes/new1.jpg" class="picture chris">
    <h3 class="title">Avengers: End Game (8.5)</h3>
    <p class="movies">This movie is Chris Evans' final appearance as Captain America, the role which will no doubt define his career when all is said and done, and once again Evans put in a fantastic performance, leading The Avengers to defeat Thanos.<br>
    <span class="top">Avengers: End Game</span> is one of the greatest superhero movies ever made, and therefore having it at the top of a list like this is something Evans is no doubt proud of, with this being the culmination of over a decades worth of storytelling.</p><br>

    <h3 class="title">Avengers: Infinity War (8.5)</h3>
    <p class="movies">Another Avengers movie takes second place in Chris Evans' 10 greatest movies according to IMDb, with the first of two movies that culminated the entire storyline, <span class="top">Avengers: Infinity War</span>, which had the shocking ending from the snap that nobody expected to see.<br>
    This was a much darker movie than had been seen before with any Marvel movie, as Thanos came out on top, leaving Evans having to play a heartbroken Captain America who, for once, didn't know what to do.</p><br>

    <h3 class="title">The Avengers (8)</h3>
    <p class="movies">With a rating of 8 on IMDb, <span class="top">Avengers</span> movie finally put some of Marvel's greatest characters into the same film as they were forced to team up to deal with Loki in this blockbuster movie that really was just the start of a much bigger journey.<br>
    Having an Avengers film is something that Marvel fans had wanted for years, and they were not left disappointed once it had happened, with this being an excellent film from start to finish.</p><br>

    <img src="imges/resizes/civilwar.jpg" class="picture chris">
    <h3 class="title">Captain America: Civil War (7.8)</h3>
    <p class="movies">However, the film did do a good job at keeping Chris Evans' character the key character to the storyline, with tensions between Captain America and Iron-Man reaching a boiling point, forcing a rift between the group.<br>
    The <span class="top">Civil War</span> storyline is one of Marvel's most popular comics, mainly because it pits the heroes against each other, rather than another villain, creating a totally different dynamic to the other movies.</p><br>

    <h3 class="title">Captain America: Winter Soldier (7.7)</h3>
    <p class="movies">Next on the list is <span class="top">Captain America: Winter Soldier</span>, which has a rating of 7.7 on IMDb, which is far too low (in this writers opinion), for what is one of the best movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, pitting Captain America against his best friend, Bucky.<br>
    Marvel has always done a good job of having its movies feel like more than just superhero films, and this particular installment really did feel like a thriller for most of the film, with a lot of politics and secrecy being involved.</p>
