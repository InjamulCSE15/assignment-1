        <p>“I used to have thoughts of wanting to climb to the top of something, or wanting to be somebody. But when you get the thing that you think you want and then you wake up and realize that you still have pockets of sadness, and that your struggle will reinvent itself, you stop chasing after those things and it’s liberating, because you realize that right here, right now, is exactly all I need.”<br>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Ever since Chris Evans landed the role of Captain America in the MCU, fans from around the world have been keeping up with his life constantly. Evans was known before he was cast for the films, but he has truly become one of the industry's most famous names after nearly 10 years of playing Cap. A perfect example of how the MCU helped Evans is that he landed a role in the star-studded cast of Knives Out. It was his first role after Avengers: Endgame.<br>
        Throughout the many movies that Evans has been a part of throughout his career, fans have had the opportunity to learn more about him. Although, there's only so much that you can learn about a player through a movie.
